const [reportForm, setReportForm] = useState({
  name: '',
  email: '',
  issue: ''
});
const [reportLoading, setReportLoading] = useState(false);
```

### API Endpoint

  {
    "name": "User Name",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "subject": "Login/Signup Issue Report",
    "message": "Issue description..."
  }
  ```

### Backend Configuration
