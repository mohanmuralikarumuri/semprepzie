## âœ… What's Fixed (5 issues)

### 1. Button Visibility in Light Mode

- Now matches MinCode section and visible in all themes

### 2. Mobile/Desktop Button Text
- **Mobile**: Shows "View" / "Run" (short)
- **Desktop**: Shows "View Code" / "Run Code" (full)
- Fixed order so correct text shows on each device

### 3. Smart Program Routing
- **Web languages** (HTML/JS/React): Run button â†’ Execution page
- **Backend languages** (Python/Java/C): Run button â†’ CodeEditor
- User gets appropriate interface based on language

### 4. Responsive Runners
- HtmlCssJsRunner and ReactRunner now fully responsive
- Use full screen on mobile
- Proper padding, text sizing, and layout
- Dark mode support throughout

### 5. Back Navigation
