# ✅ Email + Password Only Authentication System

## 🎯 **Complete Phone OTP Removal - DONE!**

I've successfully removed all phone OTP functionality and cleaned up the authentication system to use **Email + Password only**.

## 🧹 **What Was Removed:**

### HTML (`index.html`)
- ❌ Auth toggle buttons (Email Login / Phone OTP tabs)
- ❌ Phone OTP form with email + phone number inputs
- ❌ OTP input section and verification buttons
- ❌ reCAPTCHA script inclusion
- ✅ Clean single login form with email + password

### JavaScript (`script.js`)
- ❌ `showPhoneLogin()` function
- ❌ `sendPhoneOTP()` function  
- ❌ `verifyPhoneOTP()` function
- ❌ `resendPhoneOTP()` function
- ❌ Phone-related form state management
- ❌ Phone OTP button in email verification prompt
- ✅ Simplified form switching (login ↔ forgot password)

### Firebase Config (`firebase-config.js`)
- ❌ `sendPhoneOTP()` method
- ❌ `verifyPhoneOTP()` method
- ❌ reCAPTCHA initialization and management
- ❌ Phone-related error messages
- ❌ Phone authentication billing notes
- ✅ Clean email-only authentication manager

## 🎉 **Current Clean Authentication Features:**

### ✅ **Login System**
```html
<div id="loginForm" class="auth-form">
    <h3>Login to Your Account</h3>
    <input type="email" id="loginEmail" placeholder="Your College Email (@aitsrajampet.ac.in)" required>
    <input type="password" id="loginPassword" placeholder="Password" required>
    <button onclick="handleLogin()" class="auth-btn">🚀 Login</button>
    <div class="auth-links">
        <a href="#" onclick="showForgotPassword()">Forgot Password?</a>
    </div>
</div>
```

### ✅ **Domain & Student Validation**
- Only `@aitsrajampet.ac.in` emails allowed
- Student number validation from email (e.g., `23701A05B8` → `05B8`)
- Authorized student list verification

### ✅ **Password Reset**
