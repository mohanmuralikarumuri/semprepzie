## ✅ Phase 1: Database Setup

### Step 1: Create Tables
- [ ] Opened Supabase Dashboard (https://supabase.com/dashboard)
- [ ] Navigated to SQL Editor
- [ ] Ran `mincode-schema.sql`
- [ ] Verified no errors
- [ ] Checked Table Editor - `mincode_subjects` exists
- [ ] Checked Table Editor - `mincode_programs` exists

### Step 2: Load Sample Data
- [ ] In SQL Editor, ran `mincode-data.sql`
- [ ] Verified no errors
- [ ] Query: `SELECT * FROM mincode_subjects;` - Returns 3 rows
- [ ] Query: `SELECT * FROM mincode_programs;` - Returns 9 rows
- [ ] Query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mincode_programs GROUP BY subject_code;` - Returns 3 each

### Step 3: Verify Policies
- [ ] Opened Authentication > Policies
- [ ] `mincode_subjects` has "Allow public read access" policy
- [ ] `mincode_programs` has "Allow public read access" policy
- [ ] Policies show green checkmark (enabled)
